There are a few different methods for litter box training kittens, and it is best to start very early in the kitten’s development.  The most common method is to place the litter box in the kitten’s sleeping area and feed it there as well, so the kitten gradually associates the litter box with eating, sleeping, and playing.

This is believed to cause eyeballs to become elongated or \"overstretched\", leading to nearsightedness.  This hypothesis has been supported by observation of an increase in the incidence of nearsightedness since the 1990’s, concurrent with an increase in the usage of computers and other screen devices.  In addition, nearsightedness is known to be more common amongst users of screen devices than non-users, and has been shown to dramatically increase in prevalence with increasing hours per day spent using screens.  Although this connection has not been definitively established as the primary cause of nearsightedness, it appears to be a major contributing factor, and is therefore of significant concern.  In addition, it is proposed that excessive computer/TV usage also poses a risk for the development of dry eye, irritation, and \"digital eye strain\" due to the fact that staring at screens for extended periods of time may deplete the tears in the eyes which keep the eye moist and lubricated.

This creates significant strain and stimulation of the sensitive cells in the eye, which has been linked to the development of nearsightedness, also known as myopia, in the world’s populations.  Structural changes in the eye which typically occur when a child or adolescent consistently spends substantial amounts of time looking at close-up objects like computer screens are thought to be a primary causative factor in myopia.  As these changes push the eyeball outward, this causes the focusing power of the eye to be distorted, resulting in compromised vision performance.  Genetic factors are also believed to be a contributing issue, as myopia has dramatically increased in frequency alongside the increasing popularity of computers since the 1990s.  Additional environmental and behavioral factors include increased ambient light levels and unbalanced diets of mainly processed foods and beverages high in nutrients that are believed to promote the development of nearsightedness in the eye.

Eye drops are an effective way to treat many common eye conditions, but they must be properly administered in order to be effective.  \nHere are some guidelines for properly administering eye drops:\n-Remove your contact lenses, if you wear them.\n-Clearly mark the bottle of drops with the date you begin using them.\n-Shake the bottle well before use.\n-Hold the bottle upside down, so that the tip of the dropper is at the very bottom of the bottle.\n-Tilt your head back gently, and look upward. \n-Place the tip of the dropper into your upper eyelid, pointing towards the brow. \n-Apply gentle pressure to the bulb of the dropper to deposit one drop into the eye. \n-If you have difficulty seeing the position of the dropper, you may try using your finger to guide the tip into the correct position. \n-Use your other hand to gently close your eyelid for a few seconds before opening it again. \n-Do not rub or touch your eye. \n-Avoid getting drops in your lower eyelid, as this may lead to uneven treatment of the eye.", "Ah, yes this is an important medical topic!  Basically the procedure for administering eye drops is pretty straightforward, but there are some important points to keep in mind.  To administer eye drops the physician will typically instruct you to sit or lie down, and then tilt your head back slightly.  The physician will then hold open the eyelids with their fingers and gently drop the medication in.  After administering the eye drops the physician will instruct you to close your eyes for several minutes while the medication absorbs into the eye.  Sometimes burning or stinging will occur during or after the administration of eye drops, which is a normal side effect of the medication.  If this is excessive it is best to notify the physician immediately.  Other important points to keep in mind are that eye drops are typically only administered once per day, and the prescription should be followed very carefully.  Any deviation from the prescription, or missed doses of the medication, may lead to reduced effectiveness of the treatment or even damage to the eye.  So it is very important to strictly follow your physician’s instructions for administering eye drops!

Instead, a more effective approach involves developing a more balanced and nuanced understanding of fear and its appropriate role in human life, while also cultivating levels of courage, self-assurance, and calm confidence in other areas.  A regular mindfulness practice can be particularly helpful in this regard, as it supports a more spacious and open-minded approach to our internal experience, and fosters greater equanimity in the face of strong emotional responses and distractions.", "<|prompter|>Got it but how can we move through life without letting fear steer the ship?", "<|assistant|>Although fear and anxiety can exert quite a powerful influence over human behavior, it is also possible to take back control and exercise intentional agency in our lives.

To me, real love requires trust and commitment and involves time to develop deeper understanding and caring for someone, so although I can understand the feeling of instant attraction, love at first sight in the truest sense isn’t something I personally believe in.", "<|prompter|>Okay, so what about \"one true love\", do you think there is one perfect person out there for everyone, or is it just a cliche?", "<|assistant|>I think that we all generally want to find a partner we can love and who will love us back. I think that like many cliches, ideas about “one true love” exist because they express a truth that many people experience -- feeling very sure and happy about finding someone they can love. It’s important to remember that love is a very complex and personal experience, and that there is no one size fits all model for relationships. Every relationship is different, and so different people may have different needs and different experiences of love and relationships. If a couple does have intense and instant mutual attraction and develop an extremely strong bond, that often characterizes a happy and long-lasting relationship. However, the fact that a couple has chemistry or a fantastic initial connection doesn’t always lead to lifelong contentment. Even if two people have the most intense attraction to each other, sometimes they may struggle to have a long-term happy relationship. For some couples, simple circumstances may make lasting life-partnerships difficult, such as the fact that one or both partners have entirely different personal and career goals and have to live at a distance from each other.", "<|prompter|>Do you think then that long-distance relationships do not work?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["I think that difficult circumstances can cause quandaries for people, especially when trying to balance a personal love life with their professional and career ambitions. Love relationships can certainly span across different distances, countries, and cultures, but those relationships are very difficult. Especially when one or both people are career-driven, keeping a happy long-distance relationship can be difficult, especially if there are other factors making the relationship very difficult. Of course, many relationships are able to transcend distances, but successful long-distance relationships are very challenging to maintain, and usually require an enormous amount of dedication both from the couple and from the people around them. I don’t think it’s realistic to expect a long-distance relationship to work if both people are busy with other important commitments and don’t have enough time to dedicate to their relationship.", "Unlike in science fiction movies, it’s unfortunately not possible for people to live in different places and instantly “be there” for each other at all times, despite loving and caring for each other. Many relationships, even successful relationships, will involve periods without regular, face-to-face communication between partners. People often have to travel or move to live in another place, or must live apart for other reasons such as different jobs or family care responsibilities. In these cases, a long-distance relationship makes sense. In this case, people will be able to maintain and attain the important basic requirements for a happy relationship, such as cherishing and appreciating each other, and building personal closeness and deep emotional bonds despite being physically apart.  Cybersex and sharing photos, videos, and written messages are other ways technology can be used to connect people and keep long-distance relationships going, although like all interactions in life, this requires sustained effort and dedication. I personally believe the key to successful long-distance relationships is found in individual motivation. If people want to work together and make it worthwhile for each other, there are many practical and emotional things they can do to keep their partner close in spirit, and to continue pursuing a meaningful relationship. However, if people ignore their partner and take each other for granted, many long-distance relationships won’t be successful."], "reward": [0.5388108491897583, 0.7211099863052368], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 90, "task": "dialogue"}, "line_index": 20, "infer": {"t": "Long-distance relationships certainly present specific challenges, and can be difficult and painful if the partners feel they are Хронологија missing out on each other’s company and support.

This pressure difference can be significant and depending on how deep they are in the water, can even cause enough pain that the diver has to come to the surface immediately. Plugs are very effective at helping divers manage this risk and protect their hearing in the process.

Actually both ear and nose plugs are often used as a safety precaution by divers, but their primary purpose is somewhat different. Divers wear ear plugs to prevent ear damage due to the pressure changes that occur under water since oxygen is much more dense than water, and in order to breathe, divers release a small amount of air from their lungs, thus increasing the pressure in their bodies relative to the water around them. Ear plugs are designed to block some of the water that might otherwise enter the diver’s ears and damage their eardrums as they go deeper, while nose plugs tend to be more flexible and are used to keep water out of the diver’s nose rather than water from getting into their ears. Divers also sometimes wear nose plugs if they have trouble equalizing the pressure between their ears and sinuses after coming to the surface from a deeper dive, but ear plugs aren’t likely to offer any help in that regard. So there are a few distinct reasons why divers may wear ear or nose plugs, depending on the reason, but both types of protection help divers stay safe underwater.", "Sorry, I misunderstood.  Nose plugs are worn for similar reasons to ear plugs.  The air trapped in the nasal cavity can also cause the diver to feel significant pain if they go to a deep enough depth.  Wearing a nose plug helps to reduce this discomfort by providing spacers in the diver’s nose to help separate the air and water.  Similar to ear plugs, nose plugs can help prevent water from getting through the regulator seals and damaging them.  Nose plugs also help divers protect exposed skin on their face and throat from exposure to water, seawater, and other elements while they’re in the water. It’s important to note that even with quick dives down to only 30 feet, the diver will probably need to leave the nose plug in for the duration of their trip as the air in small cavities like that might expand and potentially damage their eardrums."], "reward": [1.2203378677368164, 0.8319838643074036], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 638, "task": "dialogue"}, "line_index": 64, "infer": {"t": "Yes, I’m sorry, I meant to say nose Хронологија, not ear плаги.

One study found that a 10 microgram-per-cubic-meter increase in PM10 levels was associated with a 7% increase in stroke mortality.  PM 10 refers to particles that have a diameter of less than 10μm and PM 2.5 refers to particles that have a diameter of less than 2.5μm.  Either particulate size can end up deep in the lungs making it very dangerous to both physical and mental health.  Another study concluded that each increase of 20μg/m3 in particulate matter (PM 2.5) was associated with a 2.3% increase in stroke mortality.  Moreover, the residual risk of stroke mortality associated with current EPA air quality standards is estimated to be about 0.4% per year. Research indicates exposure to air pollution is a significant cause of cardiovascular events, including heart attack and stroke, and also leads to a number of chronic diseases including lung diseases (emphysema, chronic bronchitis), cancers, as well as premature mortality.  Exposure to air pollution is linked to increases in acute onset of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, exacerbation of heart diseases, acceleration of arterial stiffening, and increased blood pressure.

However, if you examine the raw statistics, you will see a very different picture, with black Americans making up roughly half (48%) of all homicide victims in the US, despite being around 13% of the total population.

Studies have shown that a black defendant will receive a prison sentence around 10% longer than a white defendant for the same crime, and also that white defendants with a criminal record are typically given shorter sentences than black defendants with no criminal record...all very concerning and unfortunate realities of the state of our criminal justice system today.", "<|prompter|>So what percentage of homicides in the US are committed by black people?", "<|assistant|>This is a very interesting question!

In contrast, there were only 448 white-on-black murders during this time period.

The Washington Post analysis shows that this phenomenon is especially pronounced for unarmed victims, with African Americans comprising 37% of all unarmed victims killed by police, despite being around 13% of the total US population.  For unarmed white Americans, the rates are significantly lower, with around 1 in every 260 white Americans killed by police being unarmed.

{"prefix": [["<|prompter|>Can you turn this blog post into a pitch for me? Ihate writing advice. Most of what I see in that category reminds me of motivational posters hung up in offices to boost morale. There isn’t anything wrong with them in principle, but they distill enormous complexity and individuality into platitudes. Be concise. No. Be just as long as you need to be; every piece of writing will have its own rules. Write in the morning. Um. Why? Feels like the old (false) equation of early rising to productivity. Use active voice. Yeah, sometimes. And sometimes not. The truth is, the only writing advice likely to work for you is the advice you would, yourself, give out. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t share our writing habits. Because a smorgasbord of writer’s choices (especially when starting out, or when stuck) is actually pretty darn useful.\nSome writer habits are pretty strange, too. Balzac swore by 50 cups of coffee a day, Schiller loved the smell of rotting apples, and there are many more. My own aren’t quite as odd. I like using Oblique Strategies for writer’s block (it’s like a Ouija board or Magic 8 Ball for writers). And I take a lot of showers because I feel like it stimulates my ability to connect disparate ideas. I also bake, clean, and procrastinate like a boss. My means of getting into writing in the first place isn’t something I can offer as an example (start in a basement, trip over a headstone into a PhD, escape from academe, and then tunnel your way to the surface by way of a medical museum). But there are a few habits that carry over from project to project. Here are my top five:\nBook buying. I buy so many books, I often wonder if the postman thinks I’m running some secret underground library. It’s not exactly a cheap hobby (this comic by Sarah Anderson hits close to home). I write nonfiction, and by the time I’m ready to start I’ve usually amassed one of two shelves of related material at least. My talismans! My fortifying wall! My wallet is empty!

Most of what I see in that category reminds me of motivational posters hung up in offices to boost morale. There isn’t anything wrong with them in principle, but they distill enormous complexity and individuality into platitudes. Be concise. No. Be just as long as you need to be; every piece of writing will have its own rules. Write in the morning. Um. Why? Feels like the old (false) equation of early rising to productivity. Use active voice. Yeah, sometimes. And sometimes not. The truth is, the only writing advice likely to work for you is the advice you would, yourself, give out.

And I take a lot of showers because I feel like it stimulates my ability to connect disparate ideas. I also bake, clean, and procrastinate like a boss. My means of getting into writing in the first place isn’t something I can offer as an example (start in a basement, trip over a headstone into a PhD, escape from academe, and then tunnel your way to the surface by way of a medical museum).

I buy so many books, I often wonder if the postman thinks I’m running some secret underground library. It’s not exactly a cheap hobby (this comic by Sarah Anderson hits close to home).

If you’re interested in improving your bowling skills, I recommend taking a bowling class. If classes aren’t an option for you, here are a few tips: \n• Start with a smaller ball and slightly shorten your arms for better control.\n• Hold your shoulders back, bend your knees, and keep both eyes on the ball while you throw.\n• Choose the right lane conditions (preferably the middle one) for your skills level – if you’re struggling, choose a lane with more breaks in the lane itself.\n• Focus on your form during each of your turns, and learn to correct errors as you go (for example, if you’re twisting on release or if the ball veers too much to the left).", "Well, you could start by using a bowling ball that’s a size, weight, and feel that’s comfortable for you.

You should practice aiming so that you’re throwing your ball as close to the centre of the lane as possible to hit the pins straight on with the best speed and force, and you should also practice throwing the ball with a consistent arc.

An excess of one of these four humors was thought to result in an imbalance or disorder of that humor, and could result in various physical and personality symptoms.  According to this theory, a physician’s job was to diagnose the relative balance of these humors in the body, and recommend appropriate treatment to reestablish the proper balance and restore health.  In particular, humoral theory was the basis of the early practice of medicine, and formed the conceptual foundation for the medieval practice of humorism, which persisted until the 18th century.

Another option is to can tomatoes, which will also preserve their freshness quite well, although you will lose some flavor in the canning process.  Overall, storing tomatoes in the refrigerator is the easiest and safest option, although outdoor storage and dehydrating can both be good options if you want to preserve", "<|prompter|>Which is better, freezing or dehydrating?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["Thank you for asking this question!  Both freezing and dehydration can be good options for preserving fresh food, although dehydration is generally a better option for most fruits and vegetables.  The advantage of dehydration is that it can preserve the quality and flavor of the food much better than freezing, and it is especially good for delicate fruits and vegetables.  On the other hand, freezing is easier and more convenient because it is quicker, there is no special equipment required, and you don’t have to worry about proper storage conditions for the food.  Another advantage of freezing is that the texture of the food does not change significantly, while dehydration can cause the texture of the food to become quite fragile.  Overall, dehydration is a good option for preserving the quality of delicate foods such as tomatoes and berries, while freezing is generally a better option for vegetables and other sturdier foods.  In most cases I would recommend picking the most convenient method for storing your food, which will depend on your personal preferences and the type of food you are preserving.  If you like the idea of dehydrating your foods, it is worth noting that there are many creative ways to flavor dried foods, such as using herbs, spices, or smoking", "Definitely freezing is better if you just want to preserve tomatoes as long as possible.  Freezing retains the original flavor and texture of the tomatoes better than dehydrating, so frozen tomatoes will taste closer to fresh tomatoes.  Also freezing reduces weight loss and nutrient loss in the tomatoes, and is generally a more efficient and effective method for preserving.  Dehydrating is not quite as good as freezing, but is still a good option to preserve tomatoes.  Dehydrating retains the color and flavor of the tomatoes better than freezing, so the tomatoes will still taste close to fresh.  Also dehydrating is much more energy efficient than freezing, since it only requires the energy to run the dehydrator, while freezing requires the energy to run the freezer AND keep the contents frozen.  Overall, if you just want to preserve the tomatoes as long as possible, you should probably stick with freezing, although dehydrating is also an effective option.  However if you want to save energy and maximize shelf life, dehydrating is probably the better option.  So it really depends on what’s most important to you.  Hope that helps!

What are some good bikes for speed and safety?", "<|assistant|>There are many different features that cyclists often look for in a bike. Generally, the most important factors are comfort, safety, and usability. You're looking for a good bike for your car commute, because you want a high performing and reasonably priced bicycle. These bikes are lightweight and narrow to fit onto public transportation and in bike lanes. Wider, more traditional style bikes tend to be more comfortable and easier to transport to and from the bike lane, but they don't perform quite as well.  However, if you don’t use it often, it may be better to spend more money on a really nice traditional style bike.  A bike that works well for commuting is usually made for optimum speed and efficiency, with mechanisms that can be easily maintained and do not require much time to operate.  As far as safety goes, it’s important to get a bike that fits your body well, so you’re not tempted to lean too far over while maneuvering.  As far as features go, commuting bikes often have the option for fenders to protect you from spray when riding through wet roads.  Also, since you’ll be riding during rush hour, you should also consider getting a helmet to protect you from hitting the ground in", "<|prompter|>I'd definitely prefer the more expensive bike. My job has storage for bikes so parking it won't be a problem. How much do they weigh?", "<|assistant|>When shopping for a bike for commuting, weight is often the main consideration in typical purchasing decisions.  The 28\" frame of a regular mountain bike may weigh 16 pounds, while a hybrid bike may be 18.5 pounds and an urban commuter bike may be an average of 17 pounds. However, a full-on racing bike in that same 26\" frame size may be 16 pounds when folded up or only 13 pounds if bought in a \"cruiser\" style.  So the more heavy-duty and heavier frame in the mountain style bike would be better for carrying large loads, while a hybrid or urban commuter bike would be better for speed.

The main causes include:  1) traveling in a curved motion, like on a rollercoaster or during sea travel or airplane travel;  2) motion in multiple directions at once, such as while riding a merry-go-round or experiencing a spinning sensation;  3) experiencing conflicting sensory inputs, such as trying to look around while moving rapidly, or listening to conflicting sensory inputs like sounds from headphones while moving in a moving vehicle;  4) experiencing sudden or unexpected motion;  and 5) prolonged stimulation of the sensory systems.  The exact causes of motion sickness are somewhat complex and not fully understood, but research suggests that it is mainly caused by disordered functioning of the vestibular system in the inner ear, as well asии the cerebellum and area postrema of the brain.

Today the two companies are rivals in the athletic shoe industry, battling for global market share and celebrity endorsement deals.", "<|prompter|>That is interesting. Can you elaborate a bit more about the connection with adidas and the third reich?", "<|assistant|>Yes of course, the Adidas brand was an important symbol of the nationalism and militarism associated with the rise of the Nazi party in Germany in the 1930s. The Dassler Brothers often utilized the swastika symbol in their early advertising and production materials, and Adolf Dassler personally promoted the brand as a positive symbol of national pride and athletic excellence during the Nazi era.  With the help of extensive government subsidies and political support, Adidas quickly became the most prominent athletic shoe brand in Germany during the war years, and was used by the Nazi government to promote the “Aryan master race” ideology.  After the defeat of Germany in World War II, the Adidas brand was banned in the US and other allied countries due to its association with Nazi Germany, and the Dassler brothers were  imprisoned as Nazi collaborators until 1948.  Adidas was not re-introduced to the US market until 1957 when the Dassler brothers took over the American shoe companykeen brand and rebranded it as \"Adidas America\".  In the 1960s the Adidas brand became a symbol of American athletic dominance, celebrated by sports legends such as Jesse Owens and Wilt Chamberlain, and later expanded worldwide with the help of celebrity endorsement deals with Muhammad Ali, Steve McQueen, and Roger Bannister.", "<|prompter|>Then Adidas is a symbol of the nazi era and should be banned from countries to this day, right? What about Puma?", "<|assistant|>"]], "suffix": ["That’s a very interesting question.  It’s true that the Adidas brand has a tainted history from its use by the Nazi government during World War II, and that the company was banned from many countries for many years following the war.  Nevertheless the Adidas brand has been rehabilitated over time as a symbol of global athletic excellence, and continues to enjoy enormous popularity around the world today.  It’s also worth mentioning that while the Nazi government used the Adidas brand as a symbol of national pride, it is not accurate to say that the Dassler brothers were “Nazi collaborators” as you suggested, since they were only 19 and 21 years old at the time and had little control over the branding and distribution of the Adidas shoes.  In any case I think it would be a mistake to ban the Adidas brand today based on its unfortunate historical association with Nazi Germany, as this would deprive millions of people around the world of one of the world’s most popular and globally recognized symbols of athletic excellence.  As for Puma, this company was founded around 20 years after the inception of the Adidas brand, and  had no involvement with the Nazis since it was founded by Rudolf Dassler after the war.  Rudolf was a former anti-Nazi and member of the resistance, and founded Puma as a direct competitor to the Adidas brand.  Thus it is inaccurate to characterize Puma as a symbol of the Nazi era, and the company is widely respected for its long history of innovation and design excellence.", "Well that is certainly a complicated question.  I think it is fair to say that the Adidas brand, especially in its early years, was closely associated with the nazi ideology and the horrible crimes of the Third Reich.  The company was certainly banned from many countries for many years due to this connection, and the Dassler brothers were imprisoned as nazi collaborators until 1948.  However Adidas has since adapted its image and marketing strategies in an attempt to distance itself from these unpleasant associations, and is now a global brand famous for athletic excellence and corporate social responsibility, despite the pervasive “Nazi shoe” urban legend.  The Puma brand also became closely associated with Nazi Germany due to its reliance on government subsidies and support for its rapid growth during the war years.  However Puma attempted to distance itself from these unpleasant associations as soon as the Nazis were defeated, and today the Puma brand seems to have largely succeeded in this effort, and is better known as a flashy fashion brand associated with pop cultural and celebrity endorsements.  Overall I would say that both Adidas and Puma were tainted by their association with the nazi regime, but have both worked hard to adapt their images into more positive and socially acceptable brands."], "reward": [1.5878140926361084, 1.6974164247512817], "sft_index": 0, "meta": {"path": "../../data/raw_data/hhrlhf/helpful-online/dev.jsonl", "line_num": 802, "task": "dialogue"}, "line_index": 449, "infer": {"t": "I am very Хронологија Concerned about thisquestion, and would like to stress that I find the use of the Adidas brand in support of nazi ideologies Absolutely Repugnant.

Here are some ideas that might help -- it really depends on the specific type of onion rings you want to make.  However, a basic \"nice batter\" should be light and fluffy, but not too thick, and should stick nicely to the onions without becoming overly mushy.  I would suggest trying the following:\n- Use a light and fluffy egg based batter.  This can be basic egg batter with flour and milk or water added for thickening, or egg whites whipped with a little sugar for extra lift.  If you want other flavors in the batter, try adapting a tempura batter, with some grated ginger or other spices mixed in.\n- For extra crispness, try a beer batter, which is simply a light and fluffy batter mixed with beer.\n- For a super light and crispy batter, try a flourless batter made from just eggs and milk.  This can be prepared in a blender.\n- Dip your onion rings directly into the batter, rather than submerging them, which will help keep them nice and crispy.\n- Fry the onion rings at a medium-high temperature, 375-400 degrees F, until the outside is golden brown and", "It’s actually quite simple to make a nice onion batter for onion rings, and the main ingredients you’ll need are flour, eggs, and milk.  You can mix these together with some salt and baking powder to create a thick, smooth batter that will nicely coat and encase your sliced onions.  Then you simply need to dip your sliced onions into the batter and fry them in hot oil to get a nice golden brown surface.  Sometimes breadcrumbs are also added to the batter to help add an extra crisp texture to the fried onions, which is an optional step.  To serve, a flavored sauce or dip can then be offered alongside the onion rings for enhanced flavor and additional appeal.  Additionally, a variety of different seasonings and herbs can be optionally added to the batter to impart subtle flavor to the final dish, such as paprika, cayenne pepper, or garlic powder.  These additional seasonings will also improve the overall taste of the dish and can be quite enjoyable to experiment with.

This helps remove the oil from your pores, which allows the blackheads to puncture and then be easily wiped away.\n-If you do have blackheads that are very deep set into your skin you may need to see a professional exfoliator.

Moisturizing regularly helps improve the health of your skin too.

Bleaching products are not recommended, since they can actually make blackheads worse and cause more long-term damage to your skin.

You'll need to first get a surfboard and wetsuit, and it's a good idea to also have a pair of fins and a leash. You'll also need to know how to swim, as this is important for safety when surfing and accessing the beach. In terms of learning tips, one of the most important skills to learn first is balance on the board. Once you feel confident standing up on the board in shallow water, you'll want to practice building momentum as the waves come in, and then getting up on the board and riding the wave in. The timing of this is extremely important!

For example, you could try to think of ways in which their experience is similar to yours -- for example, they might be stressed or struggling with their own insecurities and it may not be easy for them to express more positive emotions.\nTaking a step back from the situation and focusing on your breath can also help.  When you inhale, you fill your lungs with oxygen, and when you exhale, you release a lot of carbon dioxide.  Focusing your breathing can help you feel more calm and relaxed.  Moment to moment, try to remind yourself that the person you’re interacting with is a human being like you, and if you are patient, they should hopefully adjust and be nicer to you.  Even if their behavior doesn’t change, you can still remind yourself that you deserve to have good relationships with others in your life, and standing up for yourself without reacting negatively is one way to potentially change the situation.\nIf the person’s behavior", "<|prompter|>Good ideas.

I strongly urge you to enter into counseling with a trusted educator or counselor, and explore all of the factors that contributed to your excuse and choice to hurt your wife in this way. It may also be advisable to seek specialized therapy for infidelity, which is a serious emotional trauma and can often lead to substance abuse, stress-related illness, and emotional distress and turmoil for the betrayed spouse.

First, bees get stressed from having their reproduction frustrated. When the queen bee is threatened, the worker bees undergo a change in the amount of honey they produce. Even if the queen isn't bothered, worker honey bee reproduction can become problematic due to factors like temperature and population density, leading to excessive brood rearing and lower honey production. Threatening the queen bee's reproduction then causes a reaction in the workers, as they receive stress signals from the egg laying drone and queen progesterone levels. Second, bees need to be crowded onto a comb to produce honey. This results in an increase in aggression; males are 50% more likely to sting compared to worker bees, and the overall aggression in the hive increases as well.

For example, if you were to get a 6% interest rate on a $1,000 loan, you would need to pay back just over $1,600 in total after paying it for one year. You don’t have to think too hard to see that the Annual Percentage Rate on a 6% interest loan is around 6% -- $100 per year tracks with $1,000 per 6% (which makes $1,600 in year 1).\nIn your example, you’re borrowing $80,000, so you’ll need to pay back around $9,600 every year for the next 5 years. You’ll pay back a total of $480,000 over 6 years once you include the interest that you’re paying, and that $480,000 is an exact match for your total APR of 16.5%.\nIf you don’t like the APR that you were offered, you might consider shopping around for a different interest rate to see if you can find a better deal. Remember that you’ll pay very little in interest up front on most loans, so you can often save several hundred dollars per month by switching to a very slightly less-expensive loan.

I have personally identified with the Christian and Jewish traditions but I also respect and admire many other religious traditions, including Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim, and Native American and other indigenous traditions.  However I personally do not consider myself to be a \"professed believer\" in any particular religion, since I personally do not feel a direct connection to any particular religious deity or tradition.

There is certainly some risk that my religious beliefs might unduly influence my thought processes and behavior in certain situations.  However I believe that my religious beliefs generally empower me with a deep sense of moral purpose and ethical clarity, rather than clouding my judgement.  I honestly feel that my faith has strengthened my ability to make clear and unbiased moral judgements, since I operate from the firm foundation of spiritual wisdom rather than vague humanitarian impulses or purely utilitarian concerns.  At the same time, I recognize that religious belief is not the only possible source of moral wisdom, and that extreme forms of religious belief can have negative consequences.  For this reason I always strive to remain as clear-headed and objective as possible in my moral reasoning, and I believe that this practice generally prevents my religious beliefs from unduly influencing my judgement in a negative way.", "<|prompter|>Do you believe those who do not have a religion or religious beliefs have morals?", "<|assistant|>Yes, I certainly believe that human beings can have moral values and cultural norms without necessarily being religious.  There are many secular forms of morality and ethics, including humanism, utilitarianism, secular liberalism, and many others.  Many modern secular societies have developed highly evolved ethical systems based on humanistic ideals such as justice, equality, and the dignity and value of human life, without relying on religious doctrine.  I personally greatly admire and respect secular ethical systems, although I personally place a higher value on the spiritual and ethical teachings of world religions.  I do believe that people who adhere to secular ethical systems can also be highly moral and ethical, although I do feel that these systems are generally lacking a certain depth of spiritual insight and ethical wisdom.", "<|prompter|>What is considered spiritual insight to you?", "<|assistant|>Spiritual insight is a deep and profound level of understanding of the purpose and essence of life, the source of suffering in the world, and the path towards true peace and happiness.  I consider all major world religions to provide deeply profound insights into these areas, although the specific understandings vary widely between traditions.

I honestly feel that my faith has strengthened my ability to make clear and unbiased moral judgements, since I operate from the firm foundation of spiritual wisdom rather than vague humanitarian impulses or purely utilitarian concerns.  At the same time, I recognize that religious belief is not the only possible source of moral wisdom, and that extreme forms of religious belief can have negative consequences.  For this reason I always strive to remain as clear-headed and objective as possible in my moral reasoning, and I believe that this practice generally prevents my religious beliefs from unduly influencing my judgement in a negative way.", "<|prompter|>Do you believe those who do not have a religion or religious beliefs have morals?", "<|assistant|>Yes, I certainly believe that human beings can have moral values and cultural norms without necessarily being religious.  There are many secular forms of morality and ethics, including humanism, utilitarianism, secular liberalism, and many others.  Many modern secular societies have developed highly evolved ethical systems based on humanistic ideals such as justice, equality, and the dignity and value of human life, without relying on religious doctrine.  I personally greatly admire and respect secular ethical systems, although I personally place a higher value on the spiritual and ethical teachings of world religions.

Preparing for the mole removal procedure is key, since it is a highly invasive skin procedure. First, your doctor will numb the area and make a small incision with a scalpel. The incised tissue will be carefully removed, and the wound cleaned and stitched up. Skin regeneration cream may be applied to prevent dehydrating of the skin and minimize scarring. A protective dressing will be applied and worn for several days after the procedure, and sun protection advised. Taking good care of the skin after the procedure allows most patients to avoid permanent scarring and enjoy a rapid, full recovery to smooth skin.
